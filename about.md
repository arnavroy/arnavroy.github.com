Hi there,

I am Arnav Roy. I am a Software Engineer at Google Inc. in Mountain View, California. I work on Machine Intelligence in [Ray Kurzweil's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Kurzweil) group. Previously I used to work in the Enterprise Search team developing software for the [Google Search Appliance](http://www.google.com/enterprise/search/products/gsa.html).

My areas of interest include Artificial Intelligence(focusing on Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, Knowledge Representation and Information Retrieval), Functional Programming, Philosophy, instrumentals and travel. I am an aspiring minimalist, uni-tasker and an avid listener.

This website serves as my thought recorder. I plan to write mainly about the aforementioned topics that interest me. Opinions expressed here are mine and not necessarily those of my employer.

Other places where you can find me on the web are [GitHub](https://github.com/arnavroy), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arnavroy) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/arnav_roy). If you need to get in touch, you can reach me at [roy.arnav@gmail.com](mailto:roy.arnav@gmail.com).

Thanks for visiting!
