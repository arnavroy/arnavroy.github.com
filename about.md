Hi,

I am Arnav Roy. I work as a Software Engineer at Google Inc. in Mountain View, California. This blog serves as my thought recorder, the opinions I express here are mine and not necessarily those of my employer.
Other places you can find me on the web are [GitHub](https://github.com/arnavroy), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arnavroy) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/arnav_roy).
You can e-mail me at <mailto:roy.arnav@gmail.com>, can't promise a quick reply though.

Thanks for visiting!
